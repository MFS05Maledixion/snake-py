# snake-py

The old arcade game snake - with python and pygame

## Create a Virtual Env

- I used python's env to Create a virtual environment to install my packages
`python -m pip venv env`

- with the appropriate python .gitignore env/ folder will be ignored

## Running the game

- make sure you activate the virtual environment
`env/Scripts/activate`

- make sure you install pygame (with virtual environment activated)
`python -m pip install pygame`

- (optional) install black, a python formatter, better than autopep8
`pip install black`

- to run the game, just run the game file
`python game.py`
